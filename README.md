#Approach

Using several user defined functions the code calculates the salary to pay using as input a salary table and working schedules from an input.txt

The **cost_function** assumes integer working hours and uses a range modular 60 to determine which salary to pay.

Any change in salary is easy to introduce using a csv in data folder. There is no fixed or global variables.

There is also a .bat file in order to execute the app in a windows machine with the only requirement to have python in the PATH
